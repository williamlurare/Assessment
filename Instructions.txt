Hello
I finished the assessment using POSTMAN for JWT Authentication and Authorization, 
The databaase I used is phpmyadmin, and I generated tables using migration 
I covered Database setup and integred, the name of my database is RDC, but either name would be fine considering
creating tables is via migration. Compeleted User Registration and Authentication with a JWT Token.
Used Token refresh mechanism so a token for each user has a expiry time of one hour.
Covered User Profile endpoint, user information will be showed with the correct JWT Token, if it's a different token 
the code will throw an error . JWT secrets and database credentials are secured and stored via .env, but 
when I use .gitignore, the current .env I have will be blocked when pushing to github.



Thank you for this assessment.
